<br>We get rooms paid for while we're here, but the destroyed homes make the inn a little packed. We do however rest.

<br>It's very pretty, but you can tell this was once a battlefield
<br>There's a structure off in the distance, it's hazy as if in a mirage


<br>She carefully makes her way towards the structure

<br>"Not yet my child, you are not ready. Your persistence will bloom"

<br>Hears 2 voices

<br>Young, light, fem (2)

<br>

<br>"Stay out of this man, you shall not claim him"


<br>

<br>"You are a fool, I already have"


<br>

<br>"What you have can be easily stripped away. You are nothing in our eyes, and you shall take nothing"

<br>Sees [her encampment, sprawled across a long valley on a hill]; beyond that she sees nothing
<br>She stands up, reaches for her axe that's not there; no people, the village is abandoned as if it was left minutes ago
<br>Hears a snarl behind her. She now has an axe in her hand. She turns and sees a shadow like form of a humanoid

<br>He was wearing spiked armor

<br>No longer in a tavern; shadow/misty [grove], crash of waves off in the distance
<br>The mist and leaves don't shake or move, frozen
<br>Around him, he sees sign of death and violence; weapons, armor, bodies, some fresh some long rotten.  
<br>In front of him, [a broken statue]
<br>This statue is a shrine that has fallen into disrepair long ago in front of him.

<br>He feels regret, sadness, and grief


<br>He feels the wind around him push him forward (15-20ft). He trips over a Morningstar embedded in the chest of a skeleton
<br>He looks back, the shrine is repaired

<br>Pieces of rock create an arm, and he hears "Cheer up, the worst is yet to come"

 <br>SUMMARY<br>
<br>
<br>SESSION<br>
<br>We wake up, the dragon fey took <a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a> and <a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a>
<br>We see dog tracks that morph into 3 separate types of tracks; 2 human, one dog

<br>Dog tracks go into brush, one set goes into woods, one set goes to <a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a>'s house


<br>As we approach <a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a>'s house on the tracks, we start to see signs of old magic

<br>Her house is heavily fortified with wards
<br>We see wards above the house and spend some time investigating

<br>There is a cloven hoof on the door, that appeared by magical means to be a deer print until it was investigated
<br><a data-href="Selene" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/_reserve/selene.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Selene</a> looks for valuables....
<br><a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> finds a journal

<br>Fragment of a very old recipe book
<br>[LEARNED THE RECIPE FOR THE BASIC HEALING POTION AND ALCHEMIST FIRE]

<br>We see tracks that lead into the house from the back door, and leaving the front door into the woods

<br>We follow the tracks into the woods, they are about 3-5 days out
<br>There are a lot of tracks in the area, the path is frequently used
<br>We are entering a wild part of the woods, with a lot of different tracks / creatures


<br>We eventually come across a small cave

<br>This cave is bad. Cave smells like shit, iron, and smoke
<br>Cervitaurs in the cave D: 

<br>Lower body of doe / buck, upper body is a woman
<br>They are centaurs warped by the fey magic




<br>There are a ton of traps in this cave, they have feral goblins they are using for warfare and traps.
<br>Selene goes down deeper into the cave, sees two goblins talking to one another

<br>One goblin has a necklace of dog-ears


<br>We had a very long and hard fight, <a data-href="Selene" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/_reserve/selene.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Selene</a> went down
<br>We discover a ritual area, there is a severed hand on a ritual table further in where we could not get without combat

<br>We see a large bed in the center of a room
<br>There is another severed hand on the Cervitaur
<br><a data-href="Novamere" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/_reserve/novamere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Novamere</a>'s religion: this is an unholy place, it is best to not remain here for long

<br>Skull of goblin on alter

<br>With the ritual, they were reaching out to some form of demon

<br>They are the cult of blood, they were probably reaching out to a demon to bind it to serve their cult... We don't know if they succeeded or not, or what demon they were trying to contact


<br>We make it back to <a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a>'s house, she casts a spell with several components

<br>A lot of the radishes we gathered
<br>She created a potion for <a data-href="Novamere" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/_reserve/novamere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Novamere</a>, which cures him of a disease he got during combat from a fungal goblin that exploded (It would have made him die, or burn in the sun)


<br>She takes <a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> and <a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a> out of the house, about 5 minutes out

<br>We stare into water, a <a data-href="Bloodwell Pit" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/misc/old-faith/bloodwell-pit.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloodwell Pit</a>

<br>A sacred location to those who follow the old ways
<br>Religious ceremonies can be held here
<br>"There are rites that can be observed on nights such like tonight"

<br>Of the 3 moons, the red one is in a new moon; the smallest moon is half full; the broken moon shows many facets of a new moon
<br>Magic waxes and wains, days like tonight are good for rituals

<br>She pulls the sword out, and it feels lighter (no repairs) and easier to use


<br>LOOT:<br>

 <br>SUMMARY<br>
<br>
<br>SESSION<br>
<br>We are hanging around <a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a>'s house

<br>We see some notes written not by her on the wall

<br>Cut to <a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a> and <a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a>

<br>They need to scare something away, not kill it

<br>"They are they way, goodbye"


<br>They find the kobald

<br>Kobold: "Why are you here"
<br><a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a>: "... Why are you here?"

<br>Why is Gamora


<br>The kobald has thumbs, and lives there. The evil <a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a> and <a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a> are there to evict him


<br>They evict the poor man for not playing property tax
<br>They get a map of the area we're in as a reward


<br>There's a knock at the door, and we see <a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a> and <a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a>!

<br>They give the map to <a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a> and <a data-href="Novamere" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/_reserve/novamere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Novamere</a> to decipher

<br>They see a few small clearings on the map about a few days from each other
<br>One location is the radish patch we were in previously
<br>Other 2 are unknown
<br>On the back of the map: "Some hidden locations, once lost. You find now. - G"




<br><a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a> will be back into town before us probably, and will tell them of our deeds
<br>The party of 2 missing guards is probably dead
<br><a data-href="Novamere" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/_reserve/novamere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Novamere</a> is probably traumatized by this ordeal of him needing a cure :) 
<br>We talk to <a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a> about the [Bodies missing in graveyard] (<a data-href="Objectives" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-sessions/(1)-autumn/objectives.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Objectives</a>)

<br>Some people about a week away, straight north, newcomers [one is probably a necromancer] &lt;- missing bodies sound like a recipe for something they would want

<br>In the <a data-href="North Wood" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(0)-obsidian_stuff/_uncategorized/north-wood.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">North Wood</a>, they are 3-4 days away now probably! We should stop by the town first


<br>Sometimes woods witches take bodies (she doesn't know of anyone else, and she didn't do it)
<br>Goblin camp is further away then the necromancer (more north)
<br><a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a> is called Auora?

<br>Dead husk of a tree that is long dead
<br><a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a> does not know our ways yet
<br>Soft floating light is glowing away inside the tree, whistles of wind
<br>Soft mulch ground, tree trunk is as wide as a table
<br>Light settles on <a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a>'s arm, feels different than a wisp in the woods; feels comforting
<br>"We are those that are, and those that have been for a very long time. You have been blessed by us, let's see if you are worthy."

<br>"I promise you I'm not"






<br>We sneak attacked a group of bandits

<br>Killed them, there are 3 known locations that our prisoner knows of
<br>There's one close, south-ish

<br>"Who is the leader of the camp?"

<br>She can be identified by her weapon, same quality of Gorza's axe, hand-axe probably
<br>She has 5 of them


<br>We were on our way to this camp????
<br>It used to be a trading post

<br>Taken over by blue tatzelwurms




<br>Leader of the bandits at large, not just this camp

<br>The have a stag head
<br>The leader, <a data-href="Stag Lord" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/people/stag-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Stag Lord</a>, also calls himself

<br>[Lord of all the hills in the wood]
<br>[Master of the horned fort] &lt;- never heard of this place
<br>[First of the freemen] &lt;- "First of the bandits" / "King of the bandits" essentially


<br>He is getting bandits in the region under his control. He has some as far as a month's travel away
<br>His control down south is unknown, but in this area every bandit calls him lord
<br>He is a drunk, doesn't usually leave his fort
<br>Maybe not a member of the cult of blood yet, but his generals are


<br>There were other towns attacked

<br>One is a large distance north of here


<br>We went to go investigate the bandit camp closest to us, before going back to towne

<br>The town is looking well, everyone has a home and people are recovering
<br>A few more corpses have also gone missing
<br>New people have not been coming since the attack

<br>For a brief moment he smells salt and iron, and as he focuses on that he is brought back to the scene of his dream (remembering, not there anew)

<br>As he looks around, the smell of salt and iron is stronger than it was before, then it fades completely

<br>She hears the crack of a vine above her, it gives her a little scroll with a red bow on top tied up by brambles
<br>Inside is a ring... She puts it on without checking with anyone who knows magic D: 

<br>May her gods protect her
<br>They kinda did? The ring feels like divine magic in some way, but different than her divine magic. 

<br>"Similar to a minor boon, like if a cleric were to get a minor boon from a god"

<br>We left off just getting back to the town

<br>The town is back to being mostly rebuilt and recovered


<br><a data-href="Jack Scratch" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/people/jack-scratch.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jack Scratch</a> has not returned

<br>She can't really identify it, as it could be many people. Here are the ones she can think of that have been exiled:

<br>Her "bastard cousin"
<br>2 of her father's siblings and 1 cousin left under bad circumstances
<br>4th son of the current king of our hold?
<br>There is a teacher that taught everyone how to write, he is still alive

<br>He is in prison, and lost a hand for attempted thievery against a noble family

<br>She wants to give us some [2x Animal Messenger] scrolls.
<br>She tells us about some rumors:

<br>A road leading into the Pendrick Hills has shown signs of use despite being out of commission for around 50 years
<br>A lot of noise coming from the abandoned town to the west, fires, clanks, bellows
<br>Heard from <a data-href="Greenbelt" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Greenbelt</a>, a very large creature has taken up residence in a temple near town.

<br>We see some eyes around the perimeter of the necromancer's camp / area

<br>Blume does not recognize this curse as old magic
<br>Selene does not see anything physically wrong with him, or any ritualized scaring
<br>His growing distance between the town and the necromancer's area is causing him to grow weak. Exhaustion will end up killing him if something is not done.
<br>"Novamere gets crop dusted by his god" - Marlo. 

<br>"... We can fix this" he hears to his side
<br>Holy water will remove the curse from within him, as the curse was forced down his throat
<br>Novamere has an awakening?


<br>Novamere prays to his god in desperation, his god creates holy water from his flask
<br>He feeds it to Jack and it helps heal him of some of the curse

<br>He was unable to sleep previously, but now he can. One of his eyes returns to normal, but one is still showing signs of a curse




<br>We arrive at town after long discussion
<br>Novamere buys &amp; makes ingredients for more holy water
<br>Blume determines the curse is not of the old ways, arcane, or Druidic magic
<br>We all buy / barter for some winter gear, some people look fancier than others

<br>The 4 of us here have a feeling of pulling in our stomach. We blink and are no longer in town
<br><a data-href="Greenbelt" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Greenbelt</a> is waiting for us smugly, and they want to make a deal

<br>It was a mutated bear since last of our knowing; 2 -&gt; 7 on the mutation scale


<br>Greenbelt says we can take anything that doesn't belong in the temple, and it will probably pay us after the job is completed

<br>Don't take things that are used in the temple, like the walls, or candles, etc.


<br>Greenbelt gave us potions for spell slots back, but <a data-href="Novamere" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/_reserve/novamere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Novamere</a> and <a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> now owe it another favor (they are the only one who got the potions, and they drank them right away)
<br>Other threats

<br>Trees that have human faces embedded into them, merging with the bark. They are not welcoming to visitors




<br>We make our way to the temple, where we start to hear and see signs of the bear

<br>As the bear approaches, we see it is covered in wounds, branches &amp; thorns. Some of the branches are coming back out of it and growing back into it
<br>We are fighting the bear

<br><a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> does a nature check, rolls bad, but these types of mutations are caused by proximity to gates to different plains of existence such as the fey wild. This could be the cause of the mutation?

<br>Mutations like this occur in extended presence of untethered magic


<br><a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a> checks to see if it's attacking because it's in pain or just because it's the way it is. It has a branch growing right into its eye, so it's likely because it's in pain
<br>"It's [The Brown One]'s turn" - Aiden
<br>Blume goes down and gets passed a note

<br>The curse causing her to go on a rampage has happened before in the past many times


<br>Greenbelt gives us a scroll with information as a reward for completing his task

<br>She hands Novamere two scrolls as well as a pouch

<br>One of those will help us discover information we are looking for

<br>We have 3 questions to the DM and we get information 


<br>One transforms into a small pearl with a hole in it

<br>[Pearl of Power]
<br>Requires attunement


<br>In the bag is super fine, almost glimmering ash. Smells of sliver and smells heavily of salt

<br>"This is to help that poor soul you were assisting in town. <a data-href="Jack Scratch" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/people/jack-scratch.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jack Scratch</a> I think was his name? This mixture has 7 uses and can purge the influences of mortal necromantic magic in any shape or size. You should only need to use one of these on him. A small sprinkle into his tea should do..."
<br>It would probably kill any necromantic creature that consumes it
<br>Catch his throw up in a metal container so it doesn't go into the earth
<br>DO NOT LET IT TOUCH YOUR SKIN, OR IT WILL EAT YOUR SKIN ALIVE?????????
<br>Disposing of it works like creating holy water, or just a fuck ton of salt




<br>She gives Selene a small beautiful piece of artwork that shows a bear. She recognizes this bear as <a data-href="Honey Tree; Brown One" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/entities/ancients/honey-tree;-brown-one.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Honey Tree; Brown One</a> (although looking differently than she does now) standing beside a stag. Beside them also stands a large stork. The Stork and stag are common symbols of <a data-href="Drasil" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/entities/gods/drasil.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Drasil</a> and <a data-href="Posaunia" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/entities/gods/posaunia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Posaunia</a>. This artwork is as old as the temple itself. 

<br>It is used to assist and heal the holder, it's small and could be worn by the holder
<br>Requires attunement


<br>She gives Blume a very small leather bound book. They are notes of a very very dear and very very dead friend 

<br>Cover has the words "<a data-href="The Rites of the Green Kings, and the Queen Consorts of Moonlight" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/items/important/the-rites-of-the-green-kings,-and-the-queen-consorts-of-moonlight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Rites of the Green Kings, and the Queen Consorts of Moonlight</a>"


<br>Her and Rory have a forehead mind-meld for a moment, as she gives Rory her thanks

<br>They walk to a pool that is similar to a <a data-href="Bloodwell Pit" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/misc/old-faith/bloodwell-pit.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloodwell Pit</a>, and Rory is told to dip the sword into the pool of water
<br>As she dips the sword in, the whole temple becomes illuminated. As she pulls the sword out, it is larger and less scarred. It's not quite a full longsword, but it is an arming sword now

<br>1d8 damage, one handed

<br>Selene asks about her dreams but gets no clear answers

<br>All 3 of the gods selene works with are speaking to the current events through her ring, which by this point is covered in frost

<br>Back home where she learned how to ride a horse. There are green fields, with a village. She hears something: "Sometimes to protect something you have to let it go."
<br>The village shifts to ruins, she hears a snarl like before. She sees something, its form shifting into various monsters. It has a peer of Gorza's in its grasp. No matter the shifting form, one of her bold brothers is in its grip. She has an axe in hand and swings at its head, avoiding her fellow. The swing goes through the beast, and it does not notice. She reaches out, grabbing her friend. They say "You can save us...". The dream fades

<br>They collapse in bed, fall asleep, then awaken. They look out the window, and one of the moons tonight is full. They feel scratching that slowly moves up their arm, across their chest, right under their sternum. They feel the same scratch they felt before. It fades slightly with time. As you breathe in, your lungs hurt as if breathing air that is far too cold. As you breathe out, a cloud of fog crystals. The scratching returns, only worse... and worse. As you look to the moon once more, you hear an echoing snarl like one you've heard many times in the woods. You wake up, scratching...

<br>Remembering the sword, but they are not themselves. As if they are seeing through the eyes of someone else. In their hand is the same sword, still broken and as they last left it. They see it being swung, cleaving through shadow, demons, and people alike.

<br>11 people in the caves, probably more... The people that go into the caves do not come back

<br>In the main tent where the Lieutenant leader was

<br>There are 4 desks, one of which is REALLY nice
<br>The more worse desks have some writing

<br>A journal in Orcish (Korvig, Centurean, the hobgoblin)

<br>6 months ago, approached by a woman in black armor requesting assistance between the two groups; the bloody hand
<br>A bit after: <a data-href="Ser Leona Blackmont" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/people/ser-leona-blackmont.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ser Leona Blackmont</a> returned, she agreed to introduce us to the Freemen.. It seems we have more allies
<br>2 weeks after: By the orders of our commander we have allied with the Freemen and the Bloody Hand.. We have legitimacy. Soon, we will take back this land with our allies
<br>Trade deal moving "cargo" up the mountain pass for the bloody hand and trading for better quality weapons with Freemen

<br>The people are cargo?


<br>About 2-3 months after: We are to send troops to aid the bloody hand and the freemen taking the town of <a data-href="Kaerliv" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/locations/cities/kaerliv.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kaerliv</a>; It will allow us a base of operations... The commander does not trust them so we will send fodder.
<br>The attack failed...
<br>A week ago from present day: New agreements with our allies, we are to capture as many travelers alive as we can. They need workers and bodies... At the moment, the bloody hand has decided to send a representative


<br>Small hidden compartment with a [Spell Scroll] that he does not recognized


<br>Investigating the final nice desk

<br>Found a lot of things <a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> can't read
<br>"Thank you for this improvement of our alliance. We are quite happy to repay you in kind." - Signed 5 bloody finger prints




<br>The team comes together to guard and reinforce the quarry
<br>What we know:

<br>1 captain in camp, 1 in cave, 2 elsewhere
<br>Orders to strip things for parts, bring them here, bandit stuff
<br>Kuhgai, the bugbear captain: Capture everyone you find alive... 
<br>Rolb, the already dead goblin: Don't bring up the town to the woman in armor... She doesn't take it well... Also don't mention her arm


<br>We take a short rest

<br>1 is in goblin that he cannot read; "Keep the cultists out of it."
<br>In common "New cargo incoming, we will be there at first light" - Kigai


<br>We prepare an ambush and defenses 
<br>We kill everyone, even the ones fleeing (except one goblin)
<br>LOOT<br>
<br>20 sp ring, 5 sp amber ring looted by <a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a>
<br>Found another [Spell Scroll], a ritual that is designed to enact a permeant form of magic weapon... Requires materials that we do not have: 100 silver worth of powdered iron along with 50 silver worth of a magical metal of your choice; can make the weapon +1 magical

<br>The prisoner escapes in the chaos
<br>Trying to kill a prisoner is a warcrime




<br>
Blume gives a person a scroll of animal messenger

<br>We explore a cave, find a very scary statue with sacrifices and blood everywhere


<br>
We fight the leader in the cave

<br>
We try to decipher who the statue is dedicated to

<br>Only one major divinity, if a major divinity is involved
<br><a data-href="Figar" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/Figar" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Figar</a>, god of slaughter, power, and division

<br>3x bottles of battle brew
<br>3x bottles of breserker brew, get a little health back or get health + attack
<br>3x bottles of potion / drink that we cannot recognize, two types of 3

<br>potion, used by soldiers, makes them less aware of their tiredness; roll to temp to ignore lvls of exhaustion; failed save gains more exhaustion


<br>Ring on goblin leader

<br>Purple gemstone
<br>
- ~~~Ring of message, allows message spell once per dawn you can choose to cast the spell telepathically as if you have used the subtle spell meta-magic; spell cast # of times per day as casting modifier~~~




<br>From killing the things in the cave

<br>Couple of scrolls, a few bottles, some money and things worth money
<br>Some magical trinkets
<br>87 silver (60s actual), 312 copper (150c actual)
<br>2x bottles that look like minor healing potion, used by rory and hallbjorn
<br>2x bottles that look like alchemist fire
<br>Pair of glasses that give off magical transmutation aura
<br>2x scrolls that give off 1st lvl magic

<br>Burning hands that does cold dmg

<br>2x trinkets that give off limited evocation magic

<br>Baaris' Feather-token, feather fall 3 times then it vanishes forever
<br>Alexandrian's Turtle-shell; reduces incoming damage by 3, 3 separate times before vanishing together

<br>Dragon: "Ah... Hello Daren. It's good to see you again... Old friend, it's been how many years since we've seen each other? Mortal years, maybe 78?"
<br>Daren?: "I have unfortunate news to pass onto you oh lord of the grove.... One of your old friends has died. King Lorei Dimbua has passed. You left after his regency ended. He wanted you at his funeral"
<br>Dragon shifts into a half-elven man (bright green eye, pale lavender eye). The dragon was there, under that new form (awe).
<br>Daren?: "They still call you many names there..."
<br>Dragon: "I wrote most of them myself! (snarky greenbelt ensues)... Did you come here to only inform me of a death?"
<br>....
<br>As the body draws the sword, they see the same symbol known in her sword. Unlike Rory's sword, it is undamaged and beautiful

 <br>
<br>We loot the necromancer's lair, located past a trap door in the middle of the former battlefield 

<br>We find some books (comprehend languages)

<br>"The story of the beginning of the story" - creating life, humanoid
<br>"On thy rooi gloss" - A treatise written like an essay... "Red moon", lycanthropy relation to the 2nd moon
<br>Written in blood? "Hoffman's guide to big game hunting", how to hunt humans book

<br>We find a hidden room with a long dead dwarf and some money, some organs removed... waist has a belt with a dagger, has etchings of a coat of arms of "Gray Cloak"
<br>The dwarf has a crown on his forehead of small boned horns


<br>We see <a data-href="Greenbelt" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Greenbelt</a> and <a data-href="Richard" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/Richard" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Richard</a>, spend some time there.

Greenbelt turns into a person and has dinner with us and Richard.
<br>If you want to know more about Greenbelt's order, seek out the Endless or the Witch Queen... The rose quart might give info
<br>The arm thing is related to the lord of vicera, or perhaps a once elder spirit

<br>This fallen elder spirit had a desire to murder and kill, all that remains is nothing but red. She represents destruction and desecration of the infinite of the hands of the finite


<br>Rory has a vision in a <a data-href="Bloodwell Pit" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/misc/old-faith/bloodwell-pit.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloodwell Pit</a>, where people are disputing over land...

<br>Boon: 

<br>Other agents of the <a data-href="Green Coven" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/factions/green-coven.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Green Coven</a> know you on sight and are able to assist you more easily

<br>Uncommon (+1) item, while wearing and attuned, the divine fury does full damage. Action (1 every dawn) to gain 1 hit-die roll.






<br>We go back to everyone, the 3 reappearing.. Take some time to calm down then leave
<br>We travel and reach our destination of a tower with potential loot

<br>They lock us out of the tower, closing the door and engaging locks
<br>We knock again, they drop a rock on us and fire arrows through the windows

<br>There is something scary in the basement, a rock with tentacles. It grabs people with 4 tentacles. It fucks us up...

<br>Ask question three and I will answer them to the best of my ability:

<br>What do you know about this, as much as possible?

<br>The wyrm who organized this is the father of that whelp you just fought. The <a data-href="Taker of Lives" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/Taker of Lives" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Taker of Lives</a> is the title he has declared for himself. But... You fought his son. Unfortunately, that is not his only child... <a data-href="Mygath" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/entities/ancients/mygath.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mygath</a> is the only black dragon I have ever known to raise their young instead of throwing them out on their own. As such, his children are quite loyal to them. I know not how many who would fight, but 3 might cause trouble. One calls these swaps home, one swamps far to the south near the bay of crabs, one far far... far to the south deep in the lands of always winter.


<br>What do we need to defeat them?

<br>What you have already done as a party is the right trail to follow... Your items, growing in your own strength. I cannot give you power you cannot handle. This ask will take you years. I do not expect you to abandon others or aimless hunt them on your own. Do not fight them on their turf, split you all up, break you down one by one. They're [ambush predators], plan your own
<br>Slowly the stone climbs up her flesh, the goddess is becoming a statue again


<br>Do you know any weakness they have?

<br>These beings pollute and destroy. They cannot pollute that which cannot be polluted. Enchanted holy water, springs... If it can cure or cleanse it is antithetical to their being. Last hearing of <a data-href="Mygath" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/entities/ancients/mygath.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mygath</a> has been centuries, similar to <a data-href="Dracolichdom" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/Dracolichdom" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dracolichdom</a>... you might look into rumors. Burry the bodies here with honors, and burn those who infested my temple. Seal the library on the lower floors, let others know. Take what you need. It is all open to you and the fellows. This is now your mission, be damed what the temple says..... You honor me child, thank you, Lady <a data-href="Willa" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/willa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Willa</a>
<br>Creak of stone, vision fades as the statue comes back into its original place. Vision goes black, blinking back in, statue is broken once again covered in blood

<br>Dreaming

<br>No longer in a tavern; shadow/misty [grove], crash of waves off in the distance
<br>The mist and leaves don't shake or move, frozen
<br>Around him, he sees sign of death and violence; weapons, armor, bodies, some fresh some long rotten.  
<br>In front of him, [a broken statue]
<br>This statue is a shrine that has fallen into disrepair long ago in front of him.

<br>He feels regret, sadness, and grief


<br>He feels the wind around him push him forward (15-20ft). He trips over a Morningstar embedded in the chest of a skeleton
<br>He looks back, the shrine is repaired

<br>Pieces of rock create an arm, and he hears "Cheer up, the worst is yet to come"




<br>He awakens

<br>Sees [her encampment, sprawled across a long valley on a hill]; beyond that she sees nothing
<br>She stands up, reaches for her axe that's not there; no people, the village is abandoned as if it was left minutes ago

<br>He was wearing spiked armor

I watched the birth of the modern gods. I watched as the first five shaped the material realm.
<br><br>
<br>Large owl-bear with a curse
<br>She is a daughter of the mother of bears <a data-href="Ur-Mother Bear" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/entities/ancients/ur-mother-bear.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ur-Mother Bear</a>

<br>Born between the mother and father
<br>The two of them shaped her out of nothing


<br>Guardian of the <a data-href="Temple of Drasil" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/locations/poi/temple-of-drasil.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Temple of Drasil</a>
<br><br>
<br>Her and her siblings were tasked with guarding sacred locations; in return her mother's people would be left to thrive
<br>She has guarded the temple every day, for a very very long time
<br><br>
<br>Took a rest and woke up one day and had branches growing out of her spine
<br>Initial Description

<br>As the bear approaches, we see it is covered in wounds, branches &amp; thorns. Some of the branches are coming back out of it and growing back into it


<br>The thing growing in her is hunting for energy. It reacts to radiant energy with growing into whatever it can get its branches into
<br>Someone in the past had tried to remove this curse with no change
<br>[Detect magic] reveals that it is similar to an occultist spell, but not one that <a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-campaign/(0)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> recognizes

<br>Mix of necromancy and transmutation
<br>She gives off an ancient magic

They have oral tales have been passed down over a thousand years. That magic is old, hers is older.


<br>Some of the brambles are surface level, some are deep inside of her


<br>[Detect Good and Evil] reveals that this:

<br>Counts as celestial and undead magic
<br>Counts as desecrated


<br>[Few can wield such curses]

<br>The large cathedral is carved into a cliff-face
<br>The temple was built upon a new temple, upon a new temple, upon a new temple, etc. 
<br>APPEARANCE<br>
<br>The temple is beautiful, with lush trees and grass growing. The trees have roots that have bodies entwined in with them.
<br>Sunlight appears to be coming from above, despite stone overhead
<br>The walls have painted murals of myths and tales

<br>Images of <a data-href="The Green Knight" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(0)-obsidian_stuff/_aka/drasil/the-green-knight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Green Knight</a>, with a sword in the ground and plants extend out of it
<br>A man in green and a woman in brown with small blue orbs in between then
<br>Large man with head of a wolf howling at a moon that is glowing green rather than white


<br>The temple is old, with some older stone seating
<br>Towards the back there is a large statue of a man in archaic plate armor. 

<br>All we can see that is not worn to time is a large smile and eyes. 
<br>One temple of his forehead has a tree branch growing, and the other has an antler
